# `mkhtml`
Makes HTML files from `header.html` and `footer.html`

## How to setup :
 - put your header in `parts/header.html`
 - put your footer in `parts/footer.html`
 - put your css/js (not mandatory) in `src/` (you have to create this folder)
 - put pages in `pages/`

Now run `mkhtml.sh` and check `builds/` it should contains your pages, with the header and the footer you defined in `parts/`
